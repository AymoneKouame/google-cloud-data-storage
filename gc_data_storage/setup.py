gc_data_storage lets you easily move data between your development environment (e.g. Jupyter Notebook) and your Google Cloud Workspace bucket. 
It integrates the command line tool gsutil.

 * Save data from your development environment to the bucket.

 * Read data from the bucket into your development environment, with the option to keep a copy in the persistent disk.

 * Copy data between different directories within the bucket or between two different buckets owned by the user.

 * Obtain a list of data saved in the bucket or the persistent disk.

gc_data_storage was originally written to be used within the All of Us Researcher Workbench environment but can be used in other Google Cloud Environments.

```
#install the package if not already done
##pip install gc-data-storage 

#import and initialize
## When initializing,  use the default AllofUS Researcher workbench bucket or input your own
from gc_data_storage import gc_data_storage as gs
gs = gs()

#list data in the bucket root directory 
gs.list_saved_data()
```
